            <h3> Step 1 - Discuss </h3>
            Determined important aspects of the website by working with members
            of the Board of the Ponaganset Education Foundation. It was decided that 
            the following details were most crucial: 
            <ul class="projectList">
                <li> Accessibility - a lot of the people that would be accessing 
                    the website weren't neccessarily tech savvy, and so ease of use 
                    was of high importance.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Staying on brand - the aesthetic of the old website needed 
                    to match that of the high school itself, including colors. It also 
                    needed to feel complete and connected.
                </li>

                <li> 
                    Content - the content that was on the old website needed to 
                    migrate over to the new website, along with some new content including 
                    sign up for upcoming events through a PHP form. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3> Step 2 - Design </h3>
            <img src="assets/media/pefdesignchoices.JPG" 
            alt="Design choices for the website" style="width: 100%">
            I came up with a color scheme and font choices, which then
            were approved by the Board members. 
            <img src="assets/media/pef_wireframes.JPG"
            alt="Wireframes for the website." style="width: 100%">
            Then I began creating wireframes and prototypes for the website.

            <h3> Step 3 - Develop </h3>
            I developed a large majority of the website and then handed
            it off to the official developer for final touches. <br/>
            The new website is currently hosted <a class="plainurl" target="_blank" 
            style="color: black"
            href="https://www.ponagansetfoundation.org/"> here, </a> and the design
            can be found <a class="plainurl" target="_blank" style="color: black"
            href="https://www.figma.com/file/sApVhlNEnADET42EDbleuF/PEF-Website?node-id=0%3A1">
            here.</a>
